Basic future concept for emacs with tramp support

Inspired by [https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/pfuture](pfuture)

Have the basic concepts of spawning a process and retrieving the
output. This works with tramp to launch processes on a remote host.
Which is sadly not working in pfuture. But looses the ability to tell
the stdout and stderr apart.
